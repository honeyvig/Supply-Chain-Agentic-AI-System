# Supply-Chain-Agentic-AI-System
To create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a Supply Chain Agentic AI System, we need to focus on the essential components that help in automating and optimizing supply chain management for companies that buy and sell products. The goal is to leverage AI techniques such as predictive analytics, process automation, optimization, and intelligent decision-making to streamline the supply chain processes.

Below is a high-level Python code structure that helps to build the MVP of a Supply Chain Agentic AI system. This code will cover the following areas:

    Data Collection & Integration: Importing relevant data from various sources (such as sales, inventory, suppliers, and customers).
    Predictive Analytics: Using machine learning models to predict demand, supply, and inventory management.
    Optimization: AI-based optimization techniques for inventory and logistics planning.
    Process Automation: Automating supply chain decisions like reordering, logistics scheduling, and supplier management.

Let's build the basic skeleton of the code for the MVP:
Prerequisites

You will need the following libraries:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

Python Code for Supply Chain Agentic AI System MVP:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample Data: Replace this with your actual data
def load_data():
    # Example Data: Orders, Inventory, and Supply data
    data = {
        "order_date": pd.date_range(start="2022-01-01", periods=100, freq="D"),
        "product_id": np.random.choice([1, 2, 3], size=100),
        "sales": np.random.randint(1, 50, size=100),
        "inventory_level": np.random.randint(10, 100, size=100),
        "supplier_lead_time": np.random.randint(2, 10, size=100),
        "demand_forecast": np.random.randint(5, 30, size=100),
    }
    
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    return df

# Step 1: Data Collection & Integration
def integrate_data(df):
    # Clean and preprocess data (this would be more advanced in a real system)
    df['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'])
    return df

# Step 2: Predictive Analytics (Demand Forecasting using a Linear Regression model)
def train_demand_forecasting_model(df):
    # Train a predictive model (for simplicity, we'll use Linear Regression for forecasting demand)
    
    # Features and Target Variable
    X = df[['inventory_level', 'supplier_lead_time']]
    y = df['demand_forecast']
    
    # Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    # Train the model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Make Predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Evaluate the model performance
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error for Demand Forecasting: {mse}")
    
    # Visualize predictions vs actual values
    plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
    plt.xlabel('Actual Demand')
    plt.ylabel('Predicted Demand')
    plt.title('Demand Forecasting: Actual vs Predicted')
    plt.show()
    
    return model

# Step 3: Optimization (Reorder Point Calculation)
def calculate_reorder_point(df, model):
    # Using the trained model to predict demand
    df['predicted_demand'] = model.predict(df[['inventory_level', 'supplier_lead_time']])
    
    # Define the reorder point as: (average demand during lead time)
    df['reorder_point'] = df['predicted_demand'] * df['supplier_lead_time']
    
    # Set reorder point for each product based on its inventory level
    df['reorder_needed'] = np.where(df['inventory_level'] <= df['reorder_point'], True, False)
    
    return df[['product_id', 'inventory_level', 'predicted_demand', 'reorder_point', 'reorder_needed']]

# Step 4: Automate Supply Chain Decisions (Reordering Products)
def automate_reordering(df):
    # Here, we would automate the decision to reorder from suppliers
    reorder_df = df[df['reorder_needed'] == True]
    
    # Output of products that need to be reordered
    print("Products that need to be reordered:")
    print(reorder_df)
    
    # This can be sent to an external API to automate the reordering process
    return reorder_df

# Main Function to run the Supply Chain Agentic AI System
def main():
    # Load and integrate data
    df = load_data()
    df = integrate_data(df)
    
    # Train demand forecasting model
    model = train_demand_forecasting_model(df)
    
    # Perform optimization (Reorder point calculation)
    df_optimized = calculate_reorder_point(df, model)
    
    # Automate supply chain decisions (Reordering products)
    reorder_df = automate_reordering(df_optimized)

    # Return or process further as needed
    return reorder_df

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reorder_products = main()
    # Save or send reorder instructions for further automation
    reorder_products.to_csv('reorder_instructions.csv', index=False)
    print("Reorder instructions saved to 'reorder_instructions.csv'")

Explanation of the Code:

    Data Collection & Integration:
        load_data(): This function generates synthetic data for orders, sales, inventory levels, and demand forecasts. In a real system, this data would be fetched from your ERP or supply chain management system.
        integrate_data(): This function preprocesses the data by converting the order date to the appropriate datetime format.

    Predictive Analytics:
        We use a Linear Regression model to predict demand based on inventory levels and supplier lead times. In a real-world scenario, more complex models like Random Forests or Neural Networks might be used for better predictions.

    Optimization:
        calculate_reorder_point(): This function calculates the Reorder Point (ROP), which helps determine when to reorder products based on predicted demand and supplier lead time.

    Process Automation:
        automate_reordering(): This function automates the process of deciding which products need to be reordered based on the reorder point. In a real-world system, this could be extended to automatically trigger orders through APIs to suppliers.

    Execution:
        The main() function integrates all the steps and outputs the products that need to be reordered. The final instructions are saved in a CSV file.

Future Enhancements for Full System:

    Data Integration: Connect to real-time APIs for live data (ERP systems, supplier APIs, etc.).
    Advanced AI Models: Use more complex models for demand forecasting and supply chain optimization (e.g., time series forecasting, reinforcement learning).
    Automation: Integrate the system with actual supplier and logistics APIs for automatic order placement and logistics scheduling.
    Real-Time Decision Making: Implement real-time supply chain decisions and optimization algorithms.
    User Interface (UI): Build a dashboard or UI to visualize data and interact with the system.

This MVP serves as a proof-of-concept and demonstrates the core functionality of a Supply Chain Agentic AI system. You can expand this system over time by adding more sophisticated algorithms, better data sources, and real-time decision-making capabilities.
